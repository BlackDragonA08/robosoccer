************************

This is the base code released on 17th May 2024, as part of the ongoing ROBO-SOCCER workshop at IIT Madras. This is meant to be a baseline for creating a Raspberry Pi Pico W based robot that can be coded using MicroPython.
Participants are free to use this code for non-commercial purposes only and are encouraged to modify it and create macros, multiple moves coded into a single button and so on. Please remember the GNU GPL v3.0 license requires attribution and also requires you to share derivative works after the competition is over.

I wish to thank Dr.Janakiraman Viraraghavan our chief mentor at IIT Madras, for his support and enthusiasm without which this robotics project will not have been successful.

A big thank you to Rajguru Electronics (I) Pvt. Ltd. Mumbai for sponsoring and being our event partners at the IIT Madras festival Paradox'24 in May 2024 - Robo Soccer event, where we first open-sourced this base code.
